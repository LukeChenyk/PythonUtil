    // Place your snippets for python here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
    // description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
    // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
    // same ids are connected.
    // Example:
    "class construtor": {
        "prefix": "cinit",
        "body": [
            "def __init__(self):",
            "\tpass"
        ],
        "description": "class construtor"
    },
    "coding": {
        "prefix": "coding",
        "body": [
            "# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-"
        ],
        "description": "# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-"
    }
